Half-Adder Implementation in Verilog
Overview:
This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple half-adder circuit using Verilog HDL, designed for deployment on an Artix-7 FPGA board. 
Half-adder Use:
Performs addition of two single-bit binary numbers, providing a sum and a carry as outputs.

Features
Inputs:
A: First single-bit input.
B: Second single-bit input.
Outputs:
Sum: XOR result of inputs A and B.
Carry: AND result of inputs A and B.
Project Files
